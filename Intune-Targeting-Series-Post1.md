Intune has a lot of great ways to target things. So why is that a problem?  
  
It’s flat. There’s no hierarchy. No built-in structure. Just a lot of options.  
  
I’ve worked with a lot of environments: greenfield, legacy, inherited drift.  
Most aren’t designed. They just happen.  
Licensed software installs where it shouldn’t.  
Security policies don’t apply where they should.  
Static groups multiply. Targeting logic turns into guesswork.  
  
And when structure is missing, even experienced admins start relying on vibe targeting. Assignments get made based on habit or gut feel.  
  
This is the first in a short series on how I’ve approached that:  
• Naming conventions that support policy scope  
• Group tags used for persona strategy  
• Targeting decisions that don’t contradict themselves  
• Where GenAI starts to fit in  
  
I’m still skeptical of “AI.” But I’m using it more. Mostly to map logic, catch edge cases, and make decisions that are harder to get wrong later.
