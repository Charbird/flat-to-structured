# Post 3 â€“ Personas and Group Tags: Targeting Like You Mean It


The first two posts were the intro course: targeting 101.  
This is where we start the advanced course.

Letâ€™s talk about **personas**, **group tags**, and how to automate your targeting structure from the moment a device is enrolled.

---

## Why Manual Targeting Doesnâ€™t Scale

Most orgs start by assigning apps and policies manually.  
Itâ€™s fine when an environment starts small but it doesnâ€™t hold up over time.

- Devices pile up  
- Exceptions multiply  
- Targeting becomes guesswork

If youâ€™re moving devices into groups by hand, **you donâ€™t have a structure** â€” you have a task list.

## Farm Animals and IT Devices

Every device is a little different.  
But **you donâ€™t hand-feed every chicken**.

Enterprise IT is about **scaling structure**.  
Thatâ€™s why we manage by **persona**: role-based bundles of apps, policies, and baselines.

- **Chickens get the same feed**: even if one doesnâ€™t like it.  
- **Sheep donâ€™t opt out of the fence**: structure is enforced.  
- **You tag the cow and assign the care plan**: not negotiate.

This is **herd management**, not pet projects.

## What is a Persona?

A **persona** is a predefined set of:

- Apps  
- Policies  
- Baselines  
- Enrollment settings

Assigned to a device **based on its role**.

### Example Personas and Group Tags

| Persona Name     | Group Tag Applied  | Example Use Case                        |
|------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `Kiosk Device`   | `GT-Kiosk01`       | Shared public device, limited access   |
| `Power User`     | `GT-PowerUser01`   | Staff needing advanced tools/apps      |
| `Standard Staff` | `GT-Staff01`       | Default config for most office staff   |
| `Contractor`     | `GT-Contractor01`  | Restricted device with web-only access |

### Persona Mapping Flow

[Device Group: Kiosk Devices]  
    â””â”€â”€ Group Tag: GT-Kiosk01  
        â””â”€â”€ Autopilot Profile: Kiosk_Profile  
        â””â”€â”€ ESP Profile: ESP_Kiosk  
        â””â”€â”€ Apps: Edge, Custom Browser  
        â””â”€â”€ Policies: Lockdown Policy, Wi-Fi Config  
        â””â”€â”€ Baselines: Security_LowRisk  

[Device Group: Standard Staff]  
    â””â”€â”€ Group Tag: GT-Staff01  
        â””â”€â”€ Autopilot Profile: Staff_Profile  
        â””â”€â”€ ESP Profile: ESP_Standard  
        â””â”€â”€ Apps: Office, Teams, OneDrive  
        â””â”€â”€ Policies: Password Policy, BitLocker  
        â””â”€â”€ Baselines: Security_Standard  

[Device Group: Power Users]  
    â””â”€â”€ Group Tag: GT-PowerUser01  
        â””â”€â”€ Autopilot Profile: Power_Profile  
        â””â”€â”€ ESP Profile: ESP_Standard  
        â””â”€â”€ Apps: Office, Teams, PowerBI, Dev Tools  
        â””â”€â”€ Policies: Password Policy, BitLocker, Local Admin  
        â””â”€â”€ Baselines: Security_Advanced  

[Device Group: Contractors]  
    â””â”€â”€ Group Tag: GT-Contractor01  
        â””â”€â”€ Autopilot Profile: Contractor_Profile  
        â””â”€â”€ ESP Profile: ESP_Light  
        â””â”€â”€ Apps: Office Web Only  
        â””â”€â”€ Policies: Conditional Access, Restricted Access  
        â””â”€â”€ Baselines: Security_Minimal

## How Group Tags Enforce Structure

Apply a **group tag** during Autopilot (or import), and Entra ID automatically assigns the device to the right persona.

### Example Dynamic Group Rule

```
(device.devicePhysicalIDs -any (_ -contains "[OrderID]:GT-Kiosk01"))
```

This finds devices with the tag `GT-Kiosk01` and places them in the `Kiosk Device` persona group.

## What Happens Next

Once in the persona group, the device gets:

- Assigned apps and policies  
- Enrollment Status Page (ESP) settings  
- Compliance and security baselines  
- A mapped enrollment profile

All of this happens **without manual intervention** from the moment the device ID is imported and tagged.

---

## Why This Matters Long-Term

This isnâ€™t just about setup: itâ€™s about **long-term care and feeding**.

- Devices stay in the right persona over time.  
- Apps and policies remain consistent â€” even as devices re-enroll or change hands.  
- **Testing is simpler**:  
  â†’ You test the *persona*, not every device.  
  â†’ Updates are managed **at scale**, not ad hoc.

Personas turn chaotic, reactive IT into **repeatable system management**.

## Real Talk: Personas Involve Tradeoffs

Not every device in a persona will need every app or policy.  
Thatâ€™s fine.

**Structure beats precision** â€” the goal is role-based consistency, not perfection.

- Some devices will get apps they donâ€™t use.  
- Some policies might not apply 1:1.  
- The key is: **it doesnâ€™t interfere with the deviceâ€™s main purpose.**

## The Goal: Automate Structure, Reduce Admin Overhead

Personas + group tags =  
**No more hand-picking apps** or chasing down exclusions.

You **design the structure once**, and **enforce it automatically** from enrollment onward.
