# Post 6 â€” Wrapping Up: Flat to Structured

This is the end of the Intune Targeting Strategy series.  
We started with a flat environment and ended with a structured, repeatable system.  

---

## What We Covered

1. **Flat by design** â†’ Why most environments start with no structure  
2. **Default targeting model** â†’ Assigning apps and policies by hand  
3. **Personas and group tags** â†’ Automating targeting from enrollment  
4. **Device naming** â†’ Creating visibility with a synthetic hierarchy  
5. **AI as a strategist** â†’ Using context and prompts to reason about structure

## The Foundation

Targeting is not the flashiest part of Intune.  
It will not be something you show off in a town hall or get a glass trophy for.  

But it is **foundational**:  
- Every policy, profile, and compliance rule depends on it  
- Without it, everything becomes one-off exceptions and manual fixes  
- With it, everything else builds on solid ground  

This is the quiet piece that enables the exciting work later:  
reporting, security, automation, and scale.

## The End State

By layering these elements together:  
- Devices align to personas from day one  
- Naming conventions provide visibility in the console  
- Group tags and dynamic groups enforce consistency  
- AI becomes a repeatable assistant for design and testing  

The result is a targeting strategy that is **systematic, scalable, and easier to operate**.

## Whatâ€™s Next

This series closes here, but the same methods apply beyond targeting:  
- License assignment  
- Compliance and baseline policies  
- Conditional access design  
- Any other place where structure beats exceptions

**Thanks for following along.**  
I would love to hear how youâ€™ve applied these ideas in your environment â€” or what gaps youâ€™re still trying to solve.
