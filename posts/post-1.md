# Post 1 – Why Structure Still Matters

**Intune has a lot of great ways to target things. So why is that a problem?**

Because it’s flat. No hierarchy. No built-in structure. Nothing guiding how you’re supposed to organize things.

It doesn’t work like the old systems. There’s no central database you can shape.  
Everything runs on telemetry data. Devices check in, things apply, and that’s about it.  
It gives you flexibility, but not much of a foundation.

I’ve seen a lot—greenfield setups, legacy rebuilds, rushed deployments.  
The pattern’s always the same. Without structure, targeting turns into guesswork.  
And with no clear guidance or best practices, even experienced admins start relying on what I call *vibe targeting*—setting assignments based on gut feel or what worked last time.

Unless you build structure into it, the system won’t do it for you.  
And when that happens, things drift.  
You end up with licensed software installing on the wrong devices.  
Security policies that never apply.  
Static groups growing out of control because nobody knows what to trust.

This series is about how I’ve dealt with that:
- Naming conventions that actually help with targeting  
- Group tags used for personas right at enrollment  
- Clear choices between user and device scoping  
- A lightweight hierarchy you build yourself  
- And where GenAI might help keep it all straight

I’ve been skeptical of the term “AI,” but tools that help me work more intelligently earn a place in my toolbox.  
Lately I’ve been using it more, mostly to model logic, spot assignment issues, or surface gaps in environments that don’t have much structure to begin with.

Maybe later, with better integration, it’ll help enforce that structure too.  
But we’re not there yet. And if we want those tools to help, the work has to start now.

Next post: Naming conventions that actually do work.
